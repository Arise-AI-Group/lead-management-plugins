## What I Need From You

**Option 1: Paste a transcript**
Full transcripts from Fireflies, Gong, Zoom, or any other tool. I'll extract everything.

**Option 2: Paste your notes**
Bullet points, rough notes, stream of consciousness — whatever you jotted down during the call.

**Option 3: Describe the call**
"Had a discovery call with Acme Corp. Their VP Ops is drowning in manual onboarding — team of 30, spending 20 hours/week on data entry. Budget around $5k/month. They want to start next month."

## Email Style Guidelines

1. **Reference the actual conversation** — Mention specific things they said
2. **150-250 words** — Concise. They're busy
3. **No markdown formatting** — Plain text for email clients
4. **One clear CTA** — Don't ask for three things
5. **Send fast** — Aim for 15 minutes after hanging up

## Tips

1. **Run this immediately after the call** — Speed wins deals
2. **More detail = better email** — Full transcripts produce the best results
3. **Name the attendees** — Helps with summary structure
4. **Tell me the deal stage** — I'll tailor the tone accordingly
5. **Flag what mattered** — "The big thing was..." helps me emphasize the right points
