# Content Engine

Turn meeting transcripts and client conversations into multi-format marketing content — LinkedIn posts, tweets, newsletter sections, and video scripts — without starting from a blank page.

## Getting Started

**Required:**
- A transcript, call notes, or description of a conversation worth repurposing

**Helpful if you have it:**
- What formats you want (LinkedIn, Twitter, newsletter, video script, or "all")
- Your brand voice guidelines or past examples
- Target audience for each format
- Any topics to emphasize or avoid

If your transcription service is connected, I'll pull transcripts automatically.

## Connectors (Optional)

| Connector | What It Adds |
|-----------|--------------|
| **~~conversation intelligence** | Pull meeting transcripts automatically |
| **~~CRM** | Stage content in content calendar, track publishing status |
| **~~chat** | Route content drafts to team for review and approval |

> **No connectors?** Paste your transcript or notes, tell me what formats you want, and I'll generate everything for you to publish manually.

## Content Extraction

From every transcript or conversation, I extract:

| Category | What I Look For |
|----------|----------------|
| **Key themes** | The 2-3 main topics discussed, recurring ideas |
| **Insights** | Non-obvious observations, expert knowledge, unique perspectives |
| **Quotable moments** | Concise, impactful statements that work as standalone content |
| **Pain points** | Problems described that resonate with your audience |
| **Solutions** | Approaches, frameworks, or tools that solve real problems |
| **Stories** | Anecdotes, case studies, before/after examples |
| **Data points** | Numbers, metrics, percentages that add credibility |
| **Actionable advice** | Steps, tips, or recommendations your audience can use |

## Output Formats

### LinkedIn Post

```
[Hook — first line that stops the scroll]

[2-3 short paragraphs expanding the insight]

[Key takeaway or actionable advice]

[Call-to-action: question, invitation to comment, or resource link]

[3-5 relevant hashtags]
```

**Guidelines:**
- 150-300 words (long-form performs better on LinkedIn)
- First line is everything — make it curiosity-driving
- Use line breaks between paragraphs (LinkedIn penalizes walls of text)
- End with a question to drive engagement
- No emojis in every line — use sparingly if at all

### Tweet Thread

```
Tweet 1/[N]: [Hook — the insight in one compelling sentence]

Tweet 2/[N]: [Context or setup]

Tweet 3/[N]: [The core insight or story]

Tweet 4/[N]: [Supporting evidence or example]

Tweet [N]/[N]: [Takeaway + CTA (follow, reply, retweet)]
```

**Guidelines:**
- 3-7 tweets per thread
- Each tweet stands alone but builds on the previous
- Tweet 1 must hook — it's the only one most people see
- No hashtags mid-thread (optional on last tweet)
- 280 characters max per tweet

### Newsletter Section

```markdown
## [Section Title]

[1-2 sentence intro connecting the topic to the reader's world]

[3-4 paragraphs covering the insight, story, or lesson]

**Key takeaway:** [One sentence summary]

**Try this:** [Actionable step the reader can take today]
```

**Guidelines:**
- 200-400 words
- More depth than social — this is for engaged subscribers
- Include one concrete action item
- Conversational but authoritative tone

### Video Script Outline

```markdown
## Video: [Title]
**Length:** [2-5 minutes]
**Format:** [Talking head / Screen share / Both]

### Hook (0:00-0:15)
[Opening question or statement that grabs attention]

### Setup (0:15-0:45)
[Context: why this matters, who it's for]

### Main Content (0:45-3:00)
1. [Point 1 — with example or visual]
2. [Point 2 — with example or visual]
3. [Point 3 — with example or visual]

### Takeaway (3:00-3:30)
[Summarize the key insight]

### CTA (3:30-4:00)
[What you want the viewer to do next]

### B-Roll / Visual Notes
- [Screen capture of X at timestamp Y]
- [Show example of Z]
```

## Content Calendar Staging

When CRM is connected, content moves through a pipeline:

```
Draft → Team Review → Approved → Scheduled → Published
```

```markdown
## Content Calendar — Week of [Date]

| Content | Format | Source | Status | Publish Date | Owner |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| [Title] | LinkedIn | Call with [Client] | Draft | [Date] | [Name] |
| [Title] | Tweet thread | Call with [Client] | Review | [Date] | [Name] |
| [Title] | Newsletter | Call with [Client] | Approved | [Date] | [Name] |
| [Title] | Video | Call with [Client] | Scheduled | [Date] | [Name] |
```

---

## Batch Processing

Process multiple transcripts into a content pipeline:

```
1. Pull recent transcripts (last 7 days)
2. Extract key insights from each
3. Identify overlapping themes across conversations
4. Generate content optimized for each format
5. Stage in content calendar
6. Route to team for review
```

This works well as a weekly content generation routine — one batch session per week keeps your channels active.

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Get Source Material

**If transcription service connected:**
```
1. Search for recent calls (last 7 days or specific meeting)
2. Pull full transcript
3. Pull attendee info and meeting context
```

**If no transcription:**
```
1. User pastes transcript, notes, or describes the conversation
2. Accept whatever format they provide
```

### Step 2: Extract Insights

```
1. Read through entire transcript
2. Identify key themes (2-3 main topics)
3. Pull quotable moments and impactful statements
4. Extract data points, metrics, and specific examples
5. Note stories and anecdotes worth retelling
6. Identify actionable advice and frameworks
```

### Step 3: Generate Content

```
1. For each requested format:
   a. Select the most relevant insights for that platform
   b. Adapt tone and structure to the format's best practices
   c. Maintain brand voice consistency
   d. Include platform-specific elements (hashtags, thread structure, etc.)
2. Cross-check that content across formats doesn't feel repetitive
   (same insight, different angle for each platform)
```

### Step 4: Review & Schedule

**If chat connected:**
```
1. Post drafts to content review channel
2. One content piece per message for easy individual feedback
3. Approve / Edit / Schedule buttons
```

**If CRM connected:**
```
1. Create content calendar entries
2. Set publish dates (spread across the week)
3. Assign owners for final review
```

**If no connectors:**
```
1. Present all content formatted and ready to copy
2. Suggest publishing schedule
3. Note any platform-specific publishing tips
```

## Brand Voice

To maintain consistency, tell me about your brand voice:

- **Tone:** Professional but approachable? Casual and direct? Technical and authoritative?
- **Perspective:** First person ("I") or company voice ("We")?
- **Topics to emphasize:** What do you want to be known for?
- **Topics to avoid:** Anything off-limits?
- **Style examples:** Link to or paste examples of content that sounds like you

I'll adapt all generated content to match. If you don't specify, I'll default to: professional, conversational, insight-driven, with a focus on practical advice.

---

## Tips

1. **Every call has content** — You don't need a breakthrough insight. Real-world observations and practical advice perform well
2. **One conversation = 4+ pieces** — A single 30-minute call can produce a LinkedIn post, tweet thread, newsletter section, and video outline
3. **Batch weekly** — Process all calls from the week in one session. More efficient and you can spot recurring themes
4. **Don't publish all at once** — Spread content across the week for consistent presence
5. **Anonymize client details** — Unless you have permission, change names and identifying details before publishing
