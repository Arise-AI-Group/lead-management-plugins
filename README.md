# Lead Management Plugins

Plugins that turn Claude into a lead management specialist for small businesses. Built for [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork), also compatible with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code).

## What This Is

A productized lead management system delivered as a Claude Cowork plugin. Covers the full pipeline from first contact to paid invoice — lead capture, discovery prep, follow-up, proposals, contracts, nurture, invoicing, and content creation.

Built by [Arise AI Group](https://arisegroup.ai) for small businesses that need effective lead management without the overhead of complex CRM setups or dedicated sales ops.

## Who It's For

- **Small service businesses** (agencies, consultancies, freelancers) with 1-10 person sales teams
- **Founders** who handle sales themselves and need a system, not a full-time hire
- **Teams** that capture leads from multiple sources (website, events, referrals) and lose track of follow-ups
- **Anyone** tired of leads going cold because nobody followed up in time

## Plugin

| Plugin | How it helps | Connectors |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **[lead-management](./lead-management)** | Capture leads, prep for calls, draft follow-ups, assemble proposals, track contracts, nurture prospects, manage invoices, and repurpose meetings into content. | Slack, HubSpot, Notion, Fireflies, Microsoft 365 |

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install the plugin
claude plugins add lead-management-plugin/lead-management

# Or install from the marketplace
claude plugins add lead-management
```

Once installed, skills activate automatically when relevant, and slash commands are available in your session.

### Available Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/lead-management:capture-lead` | Quick-capture a lead from any source with AI scoring |

### Automatic Skills

## Architecture

This plugin follows the [knowledge-work-plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins) architecture from Anthropic:

- Same file structure, conventions, and `~~placeholder` system
- Can be installed alongside other knowledge-work-plugins (sales, productivity, etc.)
- Compatible with the `cowork-plugin-management` plugin for customization
- Every component is file-based — markdown and JSON, no code, no infrastructure, no build steps

## Customizing for Your Business

These plugins ship as a generic starting point. They become much more useful when you customize them:

1. **Swap connectors** — Edit `.mcp.json` to point at your specific tools (Salesforce instead of HubSpot, Gmail instead of Microsoft 365, etc.)
2. **Add your context** — Drop your company info, service offerings, and pricing into the skill files
3. **Adjust workflows** — Modify skill instructions to match how your team actually operates
4. **Customize email templates** — Update the email drafts in each skill to match your brand voice

Use the `cowork-plugin-management` plugin or the [CONNECTORS.md](./lead-management/CONNECTORS.md) reference to identify what to swap.

## Pipeline Coverage

The plugin covers every stage of the lead-to-revenue pipeline:

```
